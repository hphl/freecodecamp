            Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to
            GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you set up SSH, you'll generate an SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent and then add the key to your GitHub account.
            Adding the SSH key to the ssh-agent ensures that your SSH key has an extra layer of security through the use
            of a passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."
          </p>
          <p>
            To use your SSH key with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you'll need to authorize it
            first. For more information, see "Authorizing an SSH key for use with a SAML single sign-on organization."
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend that you regularly review your SSH keys list and revoke any that are invalid or have been compromised.

        <article>
          <p>
            Before you generate an SSH key, you can check to see if you have any existing SSH keys.

          <div class="note">

              <strong>Note:</strong> DSA keys were deprecated in OpenSSH 7.0. If your operating system uses OpenSSH, you'll
              need to use an alternate type of key when setting up SSH, such as an RSA key. For instance, if your operating
              system is MacOS Sierra, you can set up SSH using an RSA key

          </ol>
          <p>

          <header>Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</header>
          <p>
            After you've checked for existing SSH keys, you can generate a new SSH key to use for authentication, then add it to the
            ssh-agent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't already have an SSH key, you must <a href="#">generate a new SSH key</a>. If you're unsure whether
            you already have an SSH key, check for <a href="#">existing keys</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't want to reenter your passphrase every time you use your SSH key, you can <a href="#">add your key
              to the SSH agent</a>, which manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.
          </p>
          <h3>Generating a new SSH key</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Open Git Bash.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.</p>
              <pre>
              <span>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</span>
            </pre>
              <p>This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file
                location.
              </p>
              <pre>
              <span>Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]</span>
            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see <a href="#">"Working with SSH key passphrases"</a>.</p>
              <pre>
            <span>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
                Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]</span>
          </pre>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent</h3>
          <p>Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have <a href="#">checked for existing
              SSH keys</a> and <a href="#">generated a new SSH key</a>.</p>
          <p>
            If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can use it to clone repositories and not deal with SSH keys. It also comes with
            the Git Bash tool, which is the preferred way of running <code>git</code> commands on Windows.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Ensure the ssh-agent is running:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you are using the Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, the ssh-agent should be running.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are using another terminal prompt, such as Git for Windows, you can use the "Auto-launching the ssh-agent" instructions
                  in "Working with SSH key passphrases", or start it manually:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <pre>
                  <span># start the ssh-agent in the background</span>
                  <span>$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)</span>
                  <span>pid 59566</span>
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are
                adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private
                key file.</p>
              <pre>
                  <span>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</span>
              </pre>
            </li>
            <li>

          <p>
            To configure your GitHub account to use your new (or existing) SSH key, you'll also need to add it to your GitHub account.
          </p>
          <p>Before adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account, you should have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Checked for existing SSH keys</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="#">Generated a new SSH key and added it to the ssh-agent</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account, you can reconfigure any local repositories to use SSH. For more information,
            see "<a href="#">Switching remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH</a>."
