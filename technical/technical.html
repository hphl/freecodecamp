            Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect to
            GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you set up SSH, you'll <a href="#generating_a_new_ssh_key_and_adding_it_to_the_ssh-agent">generate an SSH
              key and add it to the ssh-agent</a> and then <a href="#adding_a_new_ssh_key_to_your_github_account">add the
              key to your GitHub account</a>. Adding the SSH key to the ssh-agent ensures that your SSH key has an extra
            layer of security through the use of a passphrase. For more information, see "<a href="#working_with_ssh_key_passphrases">Working
              with SSH key passphrases</a>."
          </p>
          <p>
            To use your SSH key with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you'll need to authorize it
            first. For more information, see "<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-a-saml-single-sign-on-organization"

          <p>
            We recommend that you regularly <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-your-ssh-keys/" target="_blank">review

        <article>
          <p>You can secure your SSH keys and configure an authentication agent so that you won't have to reenter your passphrase
            every time you use your SSH keys.</p>
          <p>With SSH keys, if someone gains access to your computer, they also gain access to every system that uses that
            key. To add an extra layer of security, you can add a passphrase to your SSH key. You can use <code>ssh-agent</code>            to
            securely save your passphrase so you don't have to reenter it.</p>
          <h3>Adding or changing a passphrase</h3>
          <p>You can change the passphrase for an existing private key without regenerating the keypair by typing the following
            command:
          </p>
          <pre>
              <span class="command">$ ssh-keygen -p</span>
              <span class="comment"># Start the SSH key creation process</span>
              <span class="output">Enter file in which the key is (/Users/<em>you</em>/.ssh/id_rsa): <em>[Hit enter]</em></span>
              <span class="output">Key has comment '/Users/<em>you</em>/.ssh/id_rsa'</span>
              <span class="output">Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <em>[Type new passphrase]</em></span>
              <span class="output">Enter same passphrase again: <em>[One more time for luck]</em></span>
              <span class="output">Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.</span>
          </pre>
          <p>If your key already has a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it before you can change to a new passphrase.</p>
          <h3>Auto-launching <code>ssh-agent</code> on Git for Windows</h3>
          <p>
            If you're using Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, you don't need to follow these steps. GitHub Desktop automatically
            launches <code>ssh-agent</code> for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, follow these steps to run ssh-agent automatically when you open bash or Git shell. Copy the following lines and
            paste them into your <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> file in Git shell:
          </p>
          <pre class="bash">
<code>env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" &amp;&amp; . "$env" &gt;| /dev/null ; }
                  
agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent &gt;| "$env")
    . "$env" &gt;| /dev/null ; }
                  
agent_load_env
                  
# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2= agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l &gt;| /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; echo $?)
                
if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] &amp;&amp; [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add
fi
                 
unset env</code>
            </pre>
          <p>
            If your private key is not stored in one of the default locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/id_dsa), you'll need to tell your
            SSH authentication agent where to find it. To add your key to ssh-agent, type ssh-add ~/path/to/my_key. For more
            information, see "<a href="#generating_a_new_ssh_key_and_adding_it_to_the_ssh-agent">Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</a>"
          </p>
          <div class="tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Tip:</strong> If you want ssh-agent to forget your key after some time, you can configure it to do
              so by running <code>ssh-add -t &lt;seconds&gt;</code>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Now, when you first run Git Bash, you are prompted for your passphrase:</p>
          <pre>
              <span class="output">Initializing new SSH agent...</span>
              <span class="output">succeeded</span>
              <span class="output">Enter passphrase for /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa:</span>
              <span class="output">Identity added: /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa)</span>
              <span class="output">Welcome to Git (version 1.6.0.2-preview20080923)</span>
              <span class="command">&gt;</span>
              <span class="output">Run 'git help git' to display the help index.</span>
              <span class="output">Run 'git help ' to display help for specific commands.</span>
          </pre>
          <p>The <code>ssh-agent</code> process will continue to run until you log out, shut down your computer, or kill
            the process.</p>
