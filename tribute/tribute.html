              <h3>General Summary</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Mohandas Gandhi was born in the western part of British-ruled India on October 2, 1869.</li>
                <li>He was married at thirteen to a girl of the same age, Kasturbai.</li>
                <li>Following the death of his father, Gandhi's family sent him to England in 1888 to study law.</li>
                <li>He became interested in the philosophy of nonviolence, as expressed in the Bhagavad-Gita, Hindu sacred scripture,
                  and in Jesus Christ's Sermon on the Mount in the Christian Bible.</li>
                <li>He returned to India in 1891, but found little success in his attempts to practice law.</li>
                <li>He accepted a position in South Africa for a year, where he assisted on a lawsuit.</li>
                <li>In South Africa, he became involved in efforts to end discrimination against the Indian minority there, who
                  were oppressed both by the British and by the
                  <strong>*Boers</strong>.</li>
                <li>His wife and children had joined him, in 1896.</li>
                <li>He founded the Natal Indian Congress, which worked to further Indian interests, and commanded an Indian medical
                  corps.
                </li>
                <li>He became even more adamant in his personal principles, practicing sexual abstinence, renouncing modern technology,
                  and developing
                  <strong>*Satyagraha</strong>, "soul- force". He and his allies used the satyagraha against the white governments
                  in South Africa.</li>
                <li>By 1914, when Gandhi left South Africa and returned to India, people called him a "Mahatma", or "great soul".</li>
                <li>When the British cracked down on Indian civil liberties after World War I, Gandhi began to organize nonviolent
                  protests.
                </li>
                <li>The Amritsar Massacre, in which British troops gunned down peaceful Indian protestors, convinced Gandhi and
                  India of the need for self-rule.</li>
                <li>In the early '20s Gandhi organized large campaigns of non-cooperation that paralyzed the subcontinent's administration–and
                  led to his imprisonment, from 1922 to 1924.</li>
                <li>After his release, he withdrew from politics for a time, preferring to travel India, working among the peasantry</li>
                <li>In 1930, he wrote the Declaration of Independence of India, and then led the Salt March in protest against
                  the British monopoly on salt. British were forced to invite Gandhi to London for a Round Table Conference.</li>
                <li>The Conference foundered on the issue of how an independent India would deal with its Muslim minority, and
                  Gandhi withdrew from public life again.</li>
                <li>When World War II broke out, India erupted into violence, and many nationalist leaders, including Gandhi,
                  went to prison.</li>
                <li>Muhammed Ali Jinnah, the head of the Muslim League, demanded that a separate state be created for India's
                  Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders and the harried British agreed.</li>
                <li>August of 1947 saw India's attainment of independence–as well as its partition into two countries, India
                  and Pakistan. However, neither measure served to solve India's problems, and the country immediately fell
                  apart: Hindus and Muslims killed each other in alarming numbers while refugees fled toward the borders.</li>
                <li>He was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist in Delhi on January 30, 1948.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>*Boers</strong>, descendants of the original Dutch settlers of the region.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>*Satyagraha</strong>, method of non-violent resistance, often called "non-cooperation".</p>
